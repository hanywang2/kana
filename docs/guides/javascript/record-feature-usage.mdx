title: "Record Feature Usage"
description: "Kana needs to know whenever a user of your product has used a feature. It's a requirement so that we have accurate information on what feature's customers have used (and by how much) within the package(s) they have subscribed to."
---

<Note>
  You should implement this each time you create a feature within Kana to ensure
  your user's usage of a feature is accurately recorded.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

You will need to ensure you have details on both:

- The **user** who has used the feature

- The **feature** which the user has used

If neither the user nor feature exist yet in Kana, then you should create these first:

[Create Users](/guides/ruby/importing-and-creating/create-users)

[Create Features](/guides/ruby/importing-and-creating/create-features)

Once these are created, you will need to ensure you know the `id` of both.

Both the`id` for a [User](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#user) and a [Feature](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#feature) are defined by you upon creation in Kana.

You can find the identifiers for both in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.usekana.com), or by using the [features](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#features) and [users](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#users) queries to pull all respective records and grab the `id `from the one you need.

## Code Sample

### Basic

```javascript Node.js
import { KanaAdmin } from "@usekana/admin-kana-js";

const client = new KanaAdmin({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Replace with own Private API Key
});

const { data, error } = await client.features.recordUsage({
  userId: "124",
  featureId: "api-calls",
  delta: "1",
});
console.log(data);
console.log(error);
```

### Example

```javascript Node.js
import { KanaAdmin } from '@usekana/admin-kana-js';
import { sendMessage } from '/modules/sendMessage.js'

const userId = user.id; // Assumes there's a user object that's been fetched
const featureId = 'messages' // Replace with your feature's identifier
const delta = 1 // Defines the amount to send - function only sends 1 message

const message = { text: "Hello", to: "user@gmail.com", from: "user@company.com" }

sendMessage(message)
  .then((result) => {
    const client = new KanaAdmin({
      apiKey: API_KEY // Replace with own Private API Key
    });

    const { data, error } = await kanaClient.features.recordUsage({
      userId: userId,
      featureId: featureId,
      delta: 1
    });

    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    } else if (data.recorded == false) {
      console.log(`Kana feature usage not recorded for ${featureId}`);
    };

    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
});
```

<Note>
  This should always take place **after the feature has been successfully
  used.** Make the call when there is no possibility of error and the action
  related to the feature has taken place. This will avoid any accidental
  recording of usage when nothing has yet happened. You can always provide a
  negative `delta` in a subsequent call to revert this if needed (more in
  [recordUsage](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/mutations#recordusage)).
</Note>

## Next Steps

<Check>
  **Congratulations** ðŸŽ‰ You've now successfully tracked your user's usage of a
  feature.
</Check>

You should look to ensure this is setup for all your features and in all places where those features could be used by customers. For instance, if you had a `messages` feature, your users may be able to send messages via your UI and through an API call - both should be tracked.

As we now have details on how much of a feature a user has used, you can:

- [Fetch insights on a user's current feature usage from our API](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#showusage)

- Block usage based on if a user has no more remaining allowance

- Subscribe a user to a new package based on their feature usage

We strongly recommend following the guide on blocking customer usage next so that feature access is properly recorded and blocked when necessary.
