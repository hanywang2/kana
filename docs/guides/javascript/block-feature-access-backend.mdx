title: "Block Feature Access (Backend)"
---

Sometimes your users may not be allowed to access a particular feature because they aren't subscribed to a plan with that feature, or they have no further allowance of that feature remaining. You're going to want to identify if they are allowed to use a feature in order to **grant or block access**.

<Note>
  You should implement this each time you create a feature within Kana to ensure
  your user's don't accidentally use the feature in question when they
  shouldn't.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

You will need to ensure you have details on both:

- The **user** who has used the feature

- The **feature** which the user has used

If neither the user nor feature exist yet in Kana, then you should create these first:

[Create Users](/guides/ruby/importing-and-creating/create-users)

[Create Features](/guides/ruby/importing-and-creating/create-features)

Once these are created, you will need to ensure you know the `id` of both.

<Note>
Both the`id` for a [User](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#user) and a [Feature](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#feature) are defined by you upon creation in Kana.

You can find the identifiers for both in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.usekana.com), or by using the [features](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#features) and [users](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#users) queries to pull all respective records and grab the `id `from the one you need.

</Note>

## Code Sample

### Basic

```javascript Node.js
import { KanaAdmin } from "@usekana/admin-kana-js";

const client = new KanaAdmin({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Replace with own Private API Key
});

const { data, error } = await client.features.canUse({
  userId: "124",
  featureId: "api-calls",
});
console.log(data);
console.log(error);
```

### Example

```javascript Node.js
import { KanaAdmin } from '@usekana/admin-kana-js';
import { sendMessage } from '/modules/sendMessage.js'

const client = new KanaAdmin({
    apiKey: {API_KEY}
});

app.post('/message', function(req, res, next) {
  const userId = req.user.id; // Assumes passport is being used for auth
  const featureId = 'messages'

  const message = req.body.message // Assumes message is being sent as object in request body

  const checkAccessAndSendMessage = async () => {
    const { data, error } = await client.features.canUse({userId: userId, id: featureId});
    if (error) {
      return error;
    }
    if (data) {
      if (data.access == true) {
        const sentMessage = sendMessage(message);
        return sentMessage;
      } else {
        throw new Error("Kana: User cannot access feature");
      }
    }
  };

  checkAccessAndSendMessage().
    .then((result) => {
      console.log(result);
      res.status(200).send('Message was successfully sent');
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log(error);
      res.status(403).send(error.message);
  });
});
```

<Note>
  This should always take place **before the feature is used.** It should be the
  first thing you do to ensure you return as early as possible when they don't
  have access, preventing any unnecessary continuation or accidental usage.
</Note>

## Next Steps

<Check>
  **Congratulations** ðŸŽ‰ You've now successfully checked a users entitlement to
  a feature and blocked them from using the feature if they should have no
  access.
</Check>

You should look to ensure this is setup for all your features and in all places where those features could be used by customers. For instance, if you had a `messages` feature, your users may be able to send messages via your UI and through an API call - both should block access when necessary.

You may want to also implement something similar on the frontend of your application to prevent feature access at source.

[Block Feature Access (Frontend)](/guides/javascript/block-feature-access-frontend)

**If you haven't yet recorded usage of your features when access is granted,** **we strongly recommend this as a next step.** It's a key requirement in order for us to understand a user's entitlement towards a feature.
