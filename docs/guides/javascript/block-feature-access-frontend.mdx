title: "Block Feature Access (Frontend)"
---

Sometimes your users may not be allowed to access a particular feature because they aren't subscribed to a plan with that feature, or they have no further allowance of that feature remaining. You're going to want to identify if they are allowed to use a feature in order to **grant or block access**.

<Note>
  You should implement this each time you create a feature within Kana to ensure
  your user's don't accidentally use the feature in question when they
  shouldn't.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

You will need to ensure you have details on both:

- The **user** who has used the feature

- The **feature** which the user has used

If neither the user nor feature exist yet in Kana, then you should create these first:

[Create Users](/guides/ruby/importing-and-creating/create-users)

[Create Features](/guides/ruby/importing-and-creating/create-features)

Once these are created, you will need to ensure you know the `id` of both.

<Note>
Both the`id` for a [User](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#user) and a [Feature](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#feature) are defined by you upon creation in Kana.

You can find the identifiers for both in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.usekana.com), or by using the [features](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#features) and [users](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#users) queries to pull all respective records and grab the `id `from the one you need.

</Note>

## Code Sample

The [canusefeature-featureid](/reference/client-sdk-frontend-reference#canusefeature-featureid) SDK method will work no matter what type of feature is being used, with the returned `access` boolean being `true` when the user has access (for Binary features), has enough of a feature remaining to be used (for Consumable features), or has overage enabled (for Consumable features).

<Warning>
**Will the access boolean consider if a user will be using more than one of a feature?**

No - for Consumable features, we will only return `false` only if there's no more of the feature be used by a delta of 1\. We will not consider any greater delta currently. If the `delta` you need to provide when [recording usage](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/mutations#recordusage) of the feature is greater than 1, you will need to understand if the user can access the feature yourself by using the returned[Consumption](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#consumption) object and calculating the amount remaining via the `used` and `budget` fields.

</Warning>

### Basic

```javascript React
import { KanaUserClient } from "@usekana/client-kana-js";

const client = new KanaUserClient({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Make sure this is your PUBLIC API Key
  userId: localStorage.getItem(user).id, // Assumes user is stored as user in localStorage
});

const { data, error } = await client.canUseFeature({ featureId: "api-calls" });
console.log(data);
console.log(error);
```

### Example

```javascript React
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { KanaUserClient } from "@usekana/client-kana-js";

function App() {
  const [canUseFeature, setCanUseFeature] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchAccess = async () => {
      const kanaClient = new KanaUserClient({
        apiKey: { API_KEY }, // Make sure this is your PUBLIC API Key
        userId: localStorage.getItem(user).id, // Assumes user is stored as user in localStorage
      });

      const { data, error } = await kanaClient.canUseFeature({
        featureId: "api-calls",
      });
      if (error) {
        console.log(error);
      }
      if (data) {
        setCanUseFeature(data.access);
      }
    };

    fetchAccess();
  }, []);

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Kana Block Feature Usage Example</h1>
      <button type="button" disabled={!canUseFeature}>
        {" "}
        Use Feature{" "}
      </button>
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<Note>
  Ensure the state is set before the feature is viewed or used. If you need to
  prevent someone from navigating to the page altogether, then we recommend
  redirecting server-side (see our [Block Feature Access
  (Backend)](/guides/javascript/block-feature-access-backend) guide for example
  code).
</Note>

## Next Steps

<Check>
  **Congratulations** ðŸŽ‰ You've now successfully checked a users entitlement to
  a feature and blocked them from using the feature if they should have no
  access.
</Check>

You should look to ensure this is setup for all your features and in all places where those features could be used by customers. For instance, if you had a `messages` feature, your users may be able to send messages via your UI and through an API call - both should block access when necessary.

You may want to also implement something similar on the backend of your application for those actions which don't touch the frontend, or for any redirects before page load that you may want to action.

[Block Feature Access (Frontend)](/guides/javascript/block-feature-access-frontend)

**If you haven't yet recorded usage of your features when access is granted,** **we strongly recommend this as a next step.** It's a key requirement in order for us to understand a user's entitlement towards a feature.
