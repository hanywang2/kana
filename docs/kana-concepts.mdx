title: "Kana Concepts"
description: "In order to get Kana working, you'll need to first understand a few of the concepts that make up our product, alongside how these all work together. This guide acts as a reference for all things Kana - in particular the terminology and inner workings of how things link."

## Key Terminology

Here's three terms specific to Kana which are vital to know in order to understand how we think about them and what we expect from them:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Feature">

    A feature is **anything that can be used for billing in your product**. It does not necessarily have to be billed currently or be a part of your existing packages - but if it could be, then that’s a feature.
    Features are **included in the packages** which you offer to your **users**.
    Kana recognises two kinds of features:

    - **Binary:** There is only one of this feature in your product (ie. a particular product) whereby you give users access to the feature.
    - **Consumable:** There can be more than one of its type in your product (ie. Seat, API Call, etc.) whereby you give users an amount of this feature.

    [See more in our packages guide.](/non-technical/packages)

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Package">

    A package is a **collection of features**.
    A **user subscribes to a package** in order to access the features within a package.
    Kana recognises two kinds of packages:
    **Base:** A core package. A user has to subscribe to one base package but cannot subscribe to more than one package at a time.
    **Add-on:** An additional package which can be added on top of the base package. A user can subscribe to as many add-on packages as they want.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="User">

    A user is **anyone that uses your product**.
    A user **subscribes to a package** in order to get the features within a package.
    Your product may have a higher level which ties users together - such as a workspace - whereby multiple users would be on the same package. **Each user of your product, however, should be their own user in Kana.** You will need to subscribe them to packages individually.

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## How does everything fit together?

### Features & Package

You can create a feature.

You can also create a package. The feature can then be added to the package.

When a feature is added to a package, we record details about the feature as it exists in that particular package.

<Note>
  We create a
  [PackageFeature](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#packagefeature)
  in order to record these details.
</Note>

This includes information such as:

- The type of feature

- The limit of the feature within that package

#### Feature Type

The type of the feature within the package can either be:

- **Binary:** You give users _access_ to the feature. There is no limit.

- **Consumable:** You give users an _amount_ of this feature. There will be a limit.

As the type of feature is added when a feature is created, and is related to the feature overall (not just when it's added to a package), we will automatically record this based on what the type of the feature is.

#### Feature Limit

You can set an amount of a feature that is given to a user if they select this package. The type of feature changes the required values:

- **Binary**: No limit needs to be provided.

- **Consumable**: The number specifying the amount of the feature given in the package (ie. `“500”`).

The same feature can therefore be used across multiple packages with different limits. The type of feature will remain consistently the same throughout however.

<Note>
**What if I want to give an unlimited amount of a feature in a package?**

You can specify that the amount should be unlimited via the _Set to unlimited_ button.

</Note>

### Users & Subscriptions

You can create a user.

That user can then be subscribed to a package.

That user will then be entitled to the features within the package they are subscribed to.

<Note>
  We record this with an
  [Entitlement](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#entitlement)
  which is linked to a particular feature and user.
</Note>

When looking for how much of a feature a user is entitled to, you will see information on:

- The [PackageSubscription](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#packagesubscription) of a user to a package with that feature

- The amount of the feature that the user is entitled to plus their [Consumption](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#consumption)

#### Subscription

You can see a package which the feature in question is linked to, plus the user that is subscribed to that package and thus has access to the feature in question.

<Note>
**What if a user is subscribed to multiple packages with the same feature?**

If the user is subscribed to multiple package which contain the same feature, then we will look for the associated [PackageSubscription](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#packagesubscription) with the highest `limit` and will only return the [Entitlement](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#entitlement) (and thus [Consumption](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#consumption)) for that package/feature combination.

</Note>

#### Consumption

You can see how much of the feature the user is entitled to, and the amount which they have currently used of that feature.

<Warning>
  This only appears for a feature which is Consumable (as noted by the type of
  the feature on the related package). [More here.](/kana-concepts#feature-type)
</Warning>

<Note>
**How do I report usage of a feature to Kana?**

You will need to tell us when a user has used a particular feature, and how much of the feature they have used. You can do this through our API/SDKs with the [recordUsage](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/mutations#recordusage) mutation.
