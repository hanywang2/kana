title: "Create Users"
---

### _**Coming Soon**_

See the [createUser](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/mutations#createuser) GraphQL mutation for more on how to achieve this programmatically, or use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.usekana.com/features) to create users manually there.

**Using Stripe?**

If you integrate with Stripe, we will not only initially import all your users from existing subscriptions, but will also create new users (and subscriptions) when customers sign up to packages through Stripe.

You may use your own custom setup to achieve this, but we also provide a handy way to generate a URL so that a user can navigate through to Stripe's checkout and pay there to subscribe - see more in the [paymentlink](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/queries#paymentlink) query.
