title: "Overview"
description: "The Kana CLI is a command-line interface making it easy for engineers to review and update pricing and entitlement configurations programmatically. It allows you to define Kana packages and features through code without initial dashboard setup, reducing the friction to get started with Kana."
---

## How to setup

### 1. Install

Run the following command in your terminal to install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g @usekana/cli
```

### 2. Add API Keys

Find your private Admin (Backend) API Keys in the Dashboard. You will need both the development and live environment API Keys. Add these to a `.env` file in your project like so:

```bash
KANA_DEV_KEY="prv_test_..."
KANA_LIVE_KEY="prv_live_..."
```

<Note>
  Click on the ‘Live environment’ toggle in the upper right hand corner of the
  dashboard to switch environments. The dashboard primary colour will be purple
  when development and green when live.
</Note>

### 3. Setup your YAML file

The YAML file is the source of truth for your pricing and packaging configurations where you can see and define all your packages and features. How to initially set this upon will vary based on if you already have packages and features setup previously in Kana.

<Note>
  The generated Kana YAML configuration files will sit within a `kana` folder in
  your repository.
</Note>

#### Existing configuration

If you already have packages and features setup, run the following in the root directory of your project to autogenerate the `./kana/kana.dev.yaml` file with your existing configuration:

```bash
kana pull
```

#### New configuration

If you’re getting started for the first time without prior setup, run the following in the root directory of your project to generate an example  `./kana/kana.dev.yaml` file:

```bash
kana bootstrap
```

## How to make changes

### 1. Edit the YAML file

Add or edit the packages and features within the YAML file with the correct nesting and all necessary fields. The potential nestings/fields are:

| name     | The name of the package.                                                                                                                       |

```bash
kana validate
```

### 3. Publish the changes

When you are ready, you will need to publish your updated `kana.yaml` file to production by running the following command:

```bash
kana publish
```
