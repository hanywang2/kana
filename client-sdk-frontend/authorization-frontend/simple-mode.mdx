## Description

The Simple Mode authorization of our Client SDK uses both the **identifier of the user** who you want to pull data for (ie. the `id` on a [User](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#user)) and a **Public** **API Key** to authenticate requests.

Your token should start with `pub_` and will end with a random 32-character alphanumeric string - for example: `pub_test_794df9bu824e7d0176e079940e0915le`.

<Note>
**Where can I get my API Key from?**

You can fetch this in the [Dashboard > API Keys](https://dashboard.usekana.com/apiKeys) section under the title of _"Client API Key"_.

Bear in mind that this is **separate from the Private Admin API Key** which is instead [used for the Admin API](/admin-api-backend/authorization-backend). Make sure not to get them mixed as it's _dangerous_ to expose the Private Admin API Key.

</Note>

## Using your key

You will need to provide both the Public API Key (as `apiKey`) and the `id` of the user that you want to pull data for (as `userId`) when initializing the client.

```javascript
import { KanaUserClient } from "@usekana/client-kana-js";

const apiKey = "pub_live_xyz"; // Make sure this is your PUBLIC API Key

// Stored client-side to be assigned to this constant
const currentUser = {
  id: "123456",
  name: "Zach Read",
  email: "zach@usekana.com",
};

const kanaUserClient = new KanaUserClient({
  apiKey: apiKey,
  userId: currentUser.id,
});
```

<Warning>
  Make sure to replace the API Key with your own when using the above code
  sample.
</Warning>
