The following information is needed and available to edit:

#### Package Name

Click _Edit_ in order to edit the text of the name.

This is the name of the feature as it exists within the package. By default, this mirrors the name of the feature that was added. However, it can be different to the name of the feature so that it best reflects the feature as it exists on the package.

#### Add new features

This is to increase the amount of the feature you want to give a user if they subscribe to this package.

<Note>
  This is only present and necessary for consumable features. [See more on
  feature types here](/non-technical/features/what-are-features#feature-type).
</Note>

### 5. Click Done
