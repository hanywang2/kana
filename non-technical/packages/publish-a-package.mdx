Once a package is created, it will remain in draft [status](/non-technical/packages/what-are-packages#package-status) until it is published. A user will not be able to subscribe to the package until it is published.

<Warning>
**Do not publish the package until it is finalised** and you are ready to allow users to subscribe to it. Once a package is published, you will not be able to modify the package, nor switch it back to become a draft.

</Warning>

When you are ready, follow the steps below to publish your package.

## Steps

### 1. View the package

Go to [Packages > Drafts](https://dashboard.usekana.com/packages?type=draft) and click View & edit details on the relevant package.
