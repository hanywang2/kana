You can create features in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.usekana.com/) within the [Features](https://dashboard.usekana.com/features) section.

You should ideally create new features in Kana whenever you add a new feature to your product.

## Steps

### 1. Select feature from the drop-down menu.

The following information is needed:

#### Name.

This is the name of the feature that will be visible on the Dashboard. Make it user-friendly. This is to enable it to read as youâ€™d present to your users and so that itâ€™s easily identifiable in the product later.

#### Type.

This marks the type of feature. Select if it will be considered as a _binary_ feature. Or, If itâ€™s considered a _consumable_ feature. Binary has no value but acts as a switch. Consumable is measured by unit. [See more on feature types here](/non-technical/features/what-are-features#feature-type).

#### Identifier.

This is the unique identifier of the feature. When you integrate Kana into your product, this is the `id` that you will need to provide when making calls related to the feature. [See more on the API Feature object here](/reference/admin-api-backend-reference/objects#feature).

### 4. Click Save.
